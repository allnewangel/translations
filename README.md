This subproject is meant to host translation files for easier exchange and collaboration

Basically fork the project, start translating and then send pull requests. Also small contributions
matter. You can make a change!

On some of the more technical aspects (like file format and encoding) see this [wiki article][1],
which gives hints about IDE setup etc.
